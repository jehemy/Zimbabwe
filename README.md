# Zimbabwe project
The purpose of this project was to show my in laws from Zimbabwe what the hell a data analyst actually does but this project is also a useful chunk of code to pull world bank data using the WDI package, wrangle it and visualise various indicators for a selection of countries.

The current code for selecting indicators to visualise is pretty static, to select others I'd recommend running through the WDIsearch() function yourself and slightly modifying the current code to find and choose your desired indicators.

The current visualise section assumes all indicators are in billions of dollars.
